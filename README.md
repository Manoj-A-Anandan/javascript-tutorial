# JavaScript Learning Journey — TAP Academy Series

This repository contains all the code I practiced while following the **41-video JavaScript series by Rohit (Founder & CEO, TAP Academy)**.  
This playlist genuinely helped me understand JS from a fresh perspective , not just *what* to write, but *why* things work the way they do.

## What's Inside?

- Concepts covered in step-by-step order
- Clean and organized examples
- Focus on clarity rather than complexity

This repo is perfect if you want to:
- Start learning JavaScript from scratch 
- Revise fundamental concepts 
- Follow along while watching the same playlist
